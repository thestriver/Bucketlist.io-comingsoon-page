# Frontend Mentor - Ping coming soon page

![Design preview for the Ping coming soon page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This website is a coming soon page made for a productivity startup - Bucketlist.io

## Inspiration
This challenge was made by [FrontEnd Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). I however decided to make it for a product I've been having fun building i.e Bucketlist.io . 
Also got inspiration [Circle.so](https://circle.so) design.
## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this Coming Soon page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*



## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. Initialize your project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). This will make it easier to share your code with the community if you need some help. If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/).
2. Configure your repository to publish your code to a URL. This will also be useful if you need some help during a challenge as you can share the URL for your project with your repo URL. There are a number of ways to do this, but we recommend using [ZEIT Now](http://bit.ly/fem-zeit). We've got more information about deploying your project with ZEIT below.
3. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes that you could create to make reusable styles.
4. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
5. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
6. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.
7. If you'd like to try building pixel-perfect websites, we'd recommend checking out [PixelSnap](http://bit.ly/fem-pixelsnap). It's an awesome tool that let's you quickly measure anything on your screen. The Frontend Mentor community also gets 20% off!

## Deploying your project

As mentioned above, there are a number of ways to host your project for free. We recommend using [ZEIT Now](http://bit.ly/fem-zeit) as it's an amazing service and extremely simple to get set up with. If you'd like to use ZEIT, here are some steps to follow to get started:

1. [Sign up to ZEIT Now](http://bit.ly/fem-zeit-signup) and go through the onboarding flow, ensuring your GitHub account is connected by using their [ZEIT Now for GitHub](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/git-integrations/zeit-now-for-github) integration.
2. Connect your project to ZEIT Now from the ["Create a new project" page](https://zeit.co/new), using the "New Project From GitHub" button and selecting the project you want to deploy.
3. Once connected, every time you `git push`, ZEIT Now will create a new [deployment](https://zeit.co/docs/v2/platform/deployments) and the deployment URL will be shown on your [ZEIT Dashboard](https://zeit.co/dashboard). You will also receive an email for each deployment with the URL.



**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
